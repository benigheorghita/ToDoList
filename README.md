# ToDoList
Small ToDoList app built using PHP 5.6 with Codeigniter 3.1.3, MySql 5.6, Bootstrap 3.3.7 and a few Javascript libraries like jQuery, dateTimePicker and jCalendar. 

To be able to install this app, please place the content of the html folder in a place accessible from the browser and the rest of the folders
somewhere outside your web shared folder. 
You can change the place of the application folder also but please keep in mind to update also the paths from index.php.

After that, you can load the db.sql file which will create the DB and the needed tables. You can also change the DB name and configure
the authentication data on application/config/database.php. If you'll be using another path than localhost please also update $config['base_url']
from application/config/config.php.

Right now you should be able to run my app. Feel free to add any improvments and help me with anything you want.

Cheers!
